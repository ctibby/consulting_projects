Mountain View proposes to reverse ban on gas appliances for new construction,https://www.mv-voice.com/city-government/2024/04/08/mountain-view-proposes-to-reverse-ban-on-gas-appliances-for-new-construction/,2024-04-08 12:53:49-07:00,"In an abrupt reversal to its building requirements, Mountain View plans to roll back its ban on gas appliances in new homes and commercial developments to comply with federal law.

The City Council is expected to vote on the proposal to suspend the city’s all-electric building codes on Tuesday, April 9.

Five years ago, Mountain View adopted a set of “reach codes” – local building codes that exceed state standards – to phase out the use of natural gas in homes and commercial buildings. The reach codes prohibited natural gas hookups for cooking appliances, clothes dryers, water heaters and space conditioners (heating and cooling), as well as fire pits and fireplaces in all new and heavily renovated buildings.

At the time, city officials lauded the environmental impact of the reach codes, which would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But some industry leaders were less thrilled with the prospect of adhering to the new regulations.

This opposition came to a head in other cities, where the California Restaurant Association (CRA) filed a lawsuit against Berkeley, which was the first city to adopt an ordinance that banned gas infrastructure in new developments.

The lawsuit alleged that the ordinance was in conflict with federal law, specifically the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). Enacted in 1975 at a time when the U.S. was facing crippling oil embargos, the EPCA was passed by Congress to promote energy production and efficiency. Later on, the EPCA gave the federal government more control over energy standards.

Initially, it seemed the CRA lawsuit would not prevail. The U.S. district court dismissed it on the basis that the EPCA did not preempt Berkeley’s ordinance. “The ordinance did not directly regulate or mandate any particular type of product or appliance and its impact on consumer products was at best indirect,” according to a summary of the proceedings in the city council report.

But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision last year. It found that “the EPCA expressly preempts state and local regulations, including building codes, concerning the energy use of covered natural gas appliances,” according to a summary by city staff. The report also noted that the court maintained that local jurisdictions “could not prevent consumers from using covered products in their homes, kitchens, and businesses.”

To comply with the ruling, Mountain View plans to suspend enforcement of its all-electric requirements that prohibits the use or installation of gas appliances in new buildings. But the council report does not provide much detail about what the city intends to do next – only stating that it will monitor the legal landscape and will consult with other cities and regional groups, including Silicon Valley Clean Energy.

In February, Palo Alto halted enforcement of its all-electric building requirements. It is now planning to implement code revisions with strict energy-efficiency standards that will make it difficult to install gas appliances, specifically targeting water and space heaters that account for about 80% of a home’s greenhouse gas emissions.

Similarly, Mountain View maintains that it will continue to commit to its climate sustainability goals. “The Court’s ruling poses a significant challenge for cities across California. Mountain View remains committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and reducing the health hazards posed by gas-powered appliances,” the city said in an emailed statement.

“As we navigate developments in this area, Mountain View will continue to prioritize the well-being of all community members and residents,” it added.","The City Council is expected to vote on the proposal to suspend the city’s all-electric building codes on Tuesday, April 9.

Palo Alto council to rule on conversion of movie theater to office space,https://www.paloaltoonline.com/community/2024/04/08/palo-alto-council-to-rule-on-conversion-of-movie-theater-to-office-space/,2024-04-08 09:04:26-07:00,"When the owner of Palo Alto Square declared its plans in 2016 to shutter the CinéArts movie theater and convert it to office space, the proposal was greeted with both sadness and skepticism from the Palo Alto City Council and the broader community.

More than 1,600 residents signed a petition urging the city to preserve the theater, while council members and neighborhood leaders lamented the looming loss of another community treasure and questioned whether the property owner, Hudson Pacific Properties, can legally remove the theater, which was long known for screening foreign and independent movies. 

The theater was, after all, part of the “planned community” ordinance that the city had approved in 1969 to enable the construction of the centrally located commercial complex at 3000 El Camino Real. Removing the theater, city planners argued, would violate the ordinance and, as such, would require a zoning amendment.

While tensions temporarily ebbed in 2016 after the city and Hudson reached a deal to keep the theater in place for two more years, the proposal to convert the theater to office space is back on the table and is moving through the city’s planning process. According to the application filed last May by Jared Willis, director of construction at Hudson Pacific, the intent is the same as it was in 2016: to “convert an unused movie theater into a vibrant Class A office space.”

The plan would infill the sloped theater seating floor of Building 6, as the theater building is known, and add windows to its currently windowless walls.

“The theater’s lobby will be the new entry lobby for the office, flanked by conference rooms,” the plans state. “An open collaboration space will greet visitors and office users, which leads to the double height open office, filled with light from the new windows on three sides,” the plans state.

But while Hudson’s plans haven’t really changed since 2016, the city’s stance is no longer as fixed as it was when the project was initially proposed. Planning Director Jonathan Lait told this publication that planning staff had initially considered the movie theater as a public benefit that would have required an amendment to the Planned Community zoning to remove and replace it with offices.

“However, after reviewing the administrative record, staff has not been able to substantiate this conclusion,” Lait said in an email.

While city staff continue to process the application, Lait said they intend to refer the final decision to the council given the “extensive public interest.”

“Ultimately the City Council will have an opportunity to consider the administrative record and make a determination about the PC amendment,” Lait said in an email.

While the application remains incomplete, the current discussions between Hudson and the city’s Department of Planning and Development Services are focused on details like traffic circulation, landscaping, parking, tree protection and public art. The broader question of whether the theater — which has been shuttered since the pandemic — needs to remain as part of Palo Alto Square is still unresolved.

Lait said staff will continue to process the architectural review board application without the need for an amendment to the planned community ordinance.

At the heart of the dispute is the changing nature of the “planned community” zone, a tool that allows developers to propose projects that exceed zoning regulations and provide public benefits. When the city approved the Palo Alto Square ordinance more than 50 years ago, council members saw the development as a way to promote economic growth and raise tax revenues. While the theater was included in the list of allowed uses, along with a hotel, a barber shop and a newsstand, the ordinance did not indicate that any of these uses are actually required.

At that time, projects approved through the planned community process were viewed as public benefits themselves. The process later involved requiring developers relying on this process to explicitly list “public benefits” in order to get their projects approved. Over the years, public benefits have included grocery stores, public plazas, public art and preservation of historic structures.

In the past decade, however, Palo Alto has reverted to the old model in which approved developments are seen as the benefit, without the need to attach other amenities. Unlike in the past, the newly rebranded “planned home zoning” applies only to residential projects.

Hudson isn’t the first property owner to suggest converting the movie theater to office space. In 1997, the city successfully prevented an attempt by the prior property owner, Equity Partners, to shutter the movie theater after negotiating an extension. It did so again in 2001, when Equity once again proposed closing the theater. This time, however, city officials argued that the theater is a requirement of the zoning ordinance.

“We do know that it has to be a theater that goes there because of zoning,” Susan Arpan, who served as the city’s manager of economic resources, told the Weekly at that time.","Hudson Pacific Properties wants to convert Palo Alto Square's CinéArts theater to office space.

Big affordable housing project in San Jose could boost micro economy,https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/04/08/san-jose-house-home-affordable-build-economy-store-golf-real-estate/,,"SAN JOSE — The development of several hundred affordable homes on empty land in San Jose could help spur economic activity in the area, real estate executives say.

A housing project is planned next to the busy Topgolf sports, entertainment and dining venue near the interchange of State Route 237 and North First Street.

At one point, a prior owner of the site had proposed the development of a hotel on the prime property, which is at 7 Topgolf Drive in North San Jose’s Alviso community.

The Topgolf complex, hotels and other proposals were once seen as components that would have coalesced into a lively entertainment district.

The original plans, officially announced in 2018, called for restaurants, shops, two hotels and the Topgolf complex.

Over the years, however, the Topgolf venue became the only development completed where the entertainment district had been planned.

The latest proposal for the 3.2-acre 7 Topgolf Drive site envisions a project that would produce 780 residences, all of them affordable apartments, documents on file with San Jose planners show.

Los Angeles-based LH Housing, an affordable and workforce housing developer, is the real estate firm leading the affordable housing project.

“We are revitalizing the area around the existing Topgolf that was originally planned as the centerpiece of an entertainment hub,” LH Housing said in an email to this news organization.

The never-built entertainment district was a grandiose proposal expected to help provide an economic boom for the area.

“Our project fulfills that stalled vision,” LH Housing stated.

A housing development could be a good idea for the area, according to Bob Staedler, principal executive with Silicon Valley Synergy, a land-use consultancy.

“Getting housing closer to where people will work is always a good thing,” Staedler said.

Tech campuses, including several sites owned by search giant Google, dot the vicinity.

The residences in the proposed affordable housing development would be contained within eight buildings.

The apartments would be studios or one-bedroom units, according to the plans on file with city officials.

At one point, a 200-room hotel was envisioned for the site, a project that seemed like a good bet when the proposal was floated before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and the start of business shutdowns in March 2020.

The economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, which hobbled the lodging and travel industries worldwide and in the Bay Area, helped to torpedo the hotel development proposal.

Eventually, the development site landed in foreclosure and an affiliate of the lender took back the empty land in 2022, paying $27.6 million to buy the property.

The project’s eight buildings are all proposed as seven-story structures. One of the buildings would have retail space on the ground floor, according to the development plans.

The project team also includes Cloud Apartments, a Bay Area company that produces factory-built modular apartments that can be snapped together at a project site.

Modular projects in the past have struggled at times,” Staedler said.

Even so, what is clear is that housing at affordable prices, particularly for the middle-class workforce, continues to be in short supply in the Bay Area.

“Housing dispersed throughout San Jose should be the goal,” Staedler said. “Alviso and North San Jose will benefit from more housing.”","A housing project is planned next to the busy Topgolf sports, entertainment and dining venue.
