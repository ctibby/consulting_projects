AISummary:
The Mountain View Whisman School District is looking to overhaul its schedule at Graham and Crittenden middle schools this fall. The current proposal is to shift from eight to seven periods, which would mean that students would generally take two electives at a time, down from three currently. Parents and students are pushing back, raising concerns about the decreased time for electives, as well as longer block periods that would be added two days a week. The change comes as test scores have dropped and behavioral issues have grown coming out of the pandemic.

AISummary:
Palo Alto Link is the city’s answer to Uber and Lyft, except it's far cheaper and it doesn’t extend beyond the city's borders. The program has been fueled by a $2 million grant from the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority that is set to expire in October. The city council will have to figure out in the next two months whether to keep the service running or to pull the plug. Most council members indicated that they favor keeping the service in place, though it may look different in its next iteration.

Apr 02, 2024 08:50 AM

AISummary:
The Palo Alto City Council voted 6-1 in favor of bike lanes along El Camino Real. Council members also insisted that the thoroughfare get additional safety improvements. The state Department of Transportation will consider these additional measures over the next two or three months. The project could launch as early as this summer, Caltrans officials say. The council’s vote wasn’t the type of ironclad commitment that Caltrans was hoping for, a council member says. But it did create a path for getting to the final decision in a fairly short period of time.

AISummary:
The Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) is trying to put an end to the incessant ringing of train bells. The VTA does not have a process in place to create quiet zones in residential areas, unlike the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), which regulates heavy rail operations. “The real problem we got is we have no rights. You guys can do whatever you want to us and that’s what you’re doing,” said VTA Deputy Director of Safety and Compliance.

Mar 29, 2024 01:48 PM

AISummary:
Mountain View Whisman School District has convened a committee to review options for Graham and Crittenden middle schools. The committee is leaning towards a schedule that would cut back the current eight-period system to seven. That would give more time for each class while maintaining the same daily start and end times. The new schedule would also add a weekly advisory period, during which counselors could provide lessons on social-emotional topics and teachers could check in with their students. The board was broadly supportive of the option that the committee preferred.

AISummary:
Palo Alto's City Council will consider a proposal to remove parking spaces along El Camino Real. The proposal has galvanized both significant support and skepticism from local bicyclists. A recent review by the city’s consultant Fehr & Peers found that the project fails to comply with some of the principles of the “safe system’ approach. The city hopes to bring safety improvements to its network of high-injury roads as part of an ongoing effort to upgrade its bike master plan.

The $369-million upgrade to the treatment plant on Embarcadero Road is the city’s most expensive and most complex ongoing infrastructure project. Three tanks are currently filled, while the fourth basin sits empty as construction workers fortify its concrete base. The Bay Area Clean Water Agencies estimates that it will cost about $11 billion to implement the needed improvements. The next permit is still under development, but it is expected to give agencies 10 years to meet new thresholds for reducing nutrient loads in the region.

Mar 28, 2024 09:03 AM

AISummary:
Palo Alto is looking at revising a host of retail policies. Loosening restrictions on chain stores is on the top of the list. The city has about 461,000 square feet in vacant retail. The number has grown in recent years thanks to the rise of e-commerce and decline of office workers.. Property owners, meanwhile, claim that it’s not the rents that are driving the vacancies but grime and crime, which are deterring would-be tenants.

Mar 25, 2024 08:56 AM

AISummary:
Palo Alto and Stanford University are working on a plan to convert a portion of El Camino Park into a roadway for buses. The plan would create a direct connection between the city’s bustling transit center on University Avenue and ElCamino Real. If the project moves forward, Stanford would foot the $3.2-million bill for the new road, which would stretch from the western edge of the bus depot to the park. The project would also require removal of about 15 trees, according to the report.
