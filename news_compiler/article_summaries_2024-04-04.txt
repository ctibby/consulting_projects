 Peninsula cities are starting to feel the pressure of the state’s increased scrutiny over housing production. South San Francisco produced only 3%, or 116 units, of its total allocation in the first year of the eight-year cycle. The challenge comes not necessarily from insufficient, local-level practices, but instead from unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, such as high interest rates, an official said. The state is generally less concerned with how much housing the city ultimately constructed, but whether its housing and zoning policies could realistically accommodate its assigned RHNA numbers.

A proposed decision in the legal dispute over San Mateo County’s purchase of the La Quinta Inn and Suites might not occur until June 26. Judge Nancy Fineman set the June 26 proposed statement of decision deadline with the expectation it would be completed earlier. Both parties would have two weeks after the proposed statement to submit objections, at which point a final decision would be made. Millbrae originally filed a lawsuit against the county in November after the county Board of Supervisors passed a resolution declaring its intention to purchase the hotel and convert it into permanent housing.

The City Council is revisiting a draft outdoor dining policy. The policy would establish robust guidelines for food service businesses and require all applicable restaurants to apply for the necessary permits. According to the draft guidelines, parklet installation would not be allowed on Ralston Avenue and El Camino Real, the latter of which is not under the city’s jurisdiction. The decision caused pushback from several residents, many of whom frequent the Italian restaurant Vivace. The council agreed to explore additional policies that would make room for some parklet exceptions.

Palo Alto Link is the city’s answer to Uber and Lyft, except it's far cheaper and it doesn’t extend beyond the city's borders. The program has been fueled by a $2 million grant from the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority that is set to expire in October. The city council will have to figure out in the next two months whether to keep the service running or to pull the plug. Most council members indicated that they favor keeping the service in place, though it may look different in its next iteration.

The Palo Alto City Council voted 6-1 in favor of bike lanes along El Camino Real. Council members also insisted that the thoroughfare get additional safety improvements. The state Department of Transportation will consider these additional measures over the next two or three months. The project could launch as early as this summer, Caltrans officials say. The council’s vote wasn’t the type of ironclad commitment that Caltrans was hoping for, a council member says. But it did create a path for getting to the final decision in a fairly short period of time.

You guys can do whatever you want to us and that’s what you’re doing,” said VTA Deputy Director of Safety and Compliance.

Mountain View Whisman School District has convened a committee to review options for Graham and Crittenden middle schools. The committee is leaning towards a schedule that would cut back the current eight-period system to seven. That would give more time for each class while maintaining the same daily start and end times. The new schedule would also add a weekly advisory period, during which counselors could provide lessons on social-emotional topics and teachers could check in with their students. The board was broadly supportive of the option that the committee preferred.

Palo Alto's City Council will consider a proposal to remove parking spaces along El Camino Real. The proposal has galvanized both significant support and skepticism from local bicyclists. A recent review by the city’s consultant Fehr & Peers found that the project fails to comply with some of the principles of the “safe system’ approach. The city hopes to bring safety improvements to its network of high-injury roads as part of an ongoing effort to upgrade its bike master plan.

The next permit is still under development, but it is expected to give agencies 10 years to meet new thresholds for reducing nutrient loads in the region.

Property owners, meanwhile, claim that it’s not the rents that are driving the vacancies but grime and crime, which are deterring would-be tenants.

The project would also require removal of about 15 trees, according to the report.
